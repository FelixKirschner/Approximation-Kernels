# Approximation-Kernels

This code produces the coefficients of kernels which may be used to approximate n-variate functions over the hypercube. 
The software is based on this paper (insert arxiv link).

Plan: Also add a PDF explaining in details the theoretical details of the symmetry adapted basis construction.
